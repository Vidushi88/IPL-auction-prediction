Developing auction strategy for new IPL franchise by analyzing past IPL data to create a strong and balanced squad

**BACK STORY**
Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested during March or April and May of every year by eight teams representing eight different cities or states in India. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007.. At the conclusion of the double round-robin league, on the basis of aggregate points, the top four teams qualify for the playoffs. In this stage, the top two teams compete with each other (in a match titled "Qualifier 1"), as do the remaining two teams (in a match titled "Eliminator"). While the winner of Qualifier 1 directly qualifies for the final match, the losing team gets another chance to qualify for the final match by playing the winning team of the Eliminator match; this match is titled Qualifier 2. The winner of this subsequent Qualifier 2 match moves onto the final match. The team that wins the final match is crowned the Indian Premier League champion.

**WHAT A IPL AUTION WANTS FROM A PLAYER**
In a coming season a new team is being added to the Indian Premier League (IPL) and a mega auction is being held to build the team's squad, there are a few factors that the team's management and auction strategy would likely consider:
1.Budget: The team would need to allocate a budget for the auction and decide how much money to spend on each player.
2.Team needs: The team would need to identify the positions and types of players they need to fill out their squad and target those players in the auction.
3.Player availability: The team would need to assess the availability of players, including their current contracts with other teams and their international commitments.
4.Player form: The team would need to consider the recent form and performances of the players they are targeting.
5.Player value: The team would need to consider the market value of the players they are interested in and decide how much they are willing to pay for them.

**AS A DATA ANALYST**
As the data analysis team leader of this new team, your first step would be to gather and analyze all available data on the players who are eligible for selection in the auction. This could include data on their past performance in domestic and international cricket, their current form and fitness, and any other relevant metrics such as fielding ability, bowling economy, and strike rate.
